# Genome comparison of *Streptomyces scabiei*

  This research project employs comparative genomics to investigate *Streptomyces scabiei*, a significant plant pathogen affecting potato crops. By analyzing our four distinct strains (WSLK1-1, WSLK1-9, WSLK1-11, and WSLK1-12), we aim to uncover potential novel species and expand our understanding of genetic diversity within the *S. scabiei* complex.
Through comprehensive genomic analysis, we identify unique genetic markers, virulence factors, and metabolic pathways that contribute to pathogenicity and ecological adaptation. This repository contains the necessary scripts, example data, for profiling bacterial core genes based on UBCG2 (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12275-021-1231-4).
